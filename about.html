    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        I’m a data analyst and engineer driven by problem-solving, efficiency, and turning raw information into meaningful insight. 
        With a background that blends <strong>engineering</strong>, <strong>process optimization</strong>, and <strong>data analytics</strong>, 
        I bring a unique perspective to the work I do—balancing technical expertise with a passion for leading teams, improving systems, 
        and creating meaningful business impact.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Data Analytics with a concentration in Project Management, maintaining a 4.0 GPA. 
        Professionally, I apply analytical methods, automation engineering principles, and continuous improvement methodologies to complex 
        process challenges—whether designing a dry-strength chemistry delivery system or reducing waste using DMAIC and FMEA frameworks.
    </p>

    <p>
        I thrive at the intersection of data, engineering, and operations. I enjoy transforming problems into structured models, 
        uncovering insights, and developing solutions that improve safety, reduce cost, and increase efficiency.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of work, I'm passionate about lifelong learning—expanding my skills in Python, SQL, visualization tools, and reliability 
        engineering to continue growing as a technical and strategic leader.
